# About

Small cross-platform database engine built with Rust. A GUI based management system will be built with Tauri at a later time.

- NoSQL
- Low level and fast
- Easy to use and integrate
- Data is stored in files on the disk (not in-memory)
- Designed for small apps
- Designed to be used locally (no server/auth involved)
- Hobby project for fun

Note! This is in early development. Currently almost nothing is done!

This is my first big project with Rust and my first big low-level software project. Therefore things can be messy at the start.
